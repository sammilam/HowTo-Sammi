        <p id="selfText"> Two professors of psychology from the University of Rochester in the mid-80s—Richard Ryan and Edward Deci, created the self-motivation theory.
            <br>
            <br>
            The theory is one of the most popular in the field of motivation and focuses on the different drivers behind our behavior—i.e., the intrinsic and extrinsic motivators. There are three main needs the theory further states, that can help us meet our need for growth: Competence, Autonomy, and Relatedness (CAR).
            <br>
            <br>
            If our jobs allow us to learn and grow, and if we have enough autonomy to do things our way and be creative, we will be more driven to give our best, and our performance will soar. In addition, as humans are social beings, we also need to feel connected to others and respected.
            <br>
            <br>
            These sources of intrinsic motivation, separately and in combination, can become powerful instigators to keep us thriving, even when we feel uninspired and unmotivated.

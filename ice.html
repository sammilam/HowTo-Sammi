        <p id="selfText">A study conducted in 2016 found that despite the lack of opportunities for professional
            development or incentives, high-performing employees in a Mexican factory remained motivated. The research
            tracked workers who did the same daily tasks, with virtually zero chances for learning new skills,
            developing professionally, or being promoted. Everyone was paid the same, regardless of performance. So,
            there was no extrinsic motivation other than keeping oneâ€™s job.

            <br>
            However, the study identified "family motivation" as a powerful driver. Workers who prioritized supporting
            their families performed better. This motive tapped deeper than personal ambition and highlighted the
            importance of doing things not just for oneself but for loved ones. It's a powerful reminder that taking
            care of our families can also drive us to be our best selves. Ultimately, the study shows that even when
            external incentives are lacking, motivation can be found in the desire to support and care for those we
            love.

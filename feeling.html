        <p id="selfText"> A great piece in the Harvard Business Review points out that when we say things such as “I
            can’t make myself go to the gym” or “I can’t get up early,” what we mean is that we don’t feel like it.
            Nothing that psychically prevents us from doing those things, apart from our laziness .
            <br>
            <br>
            Sometimes, it so happens that you may not want to do something in the beginning, but once you start, you get
            into the flow and find your intrinsic motivation.
            <br>
            <br>
            For instance, you don’t feel like going to the gym after a long day at work, rather than debating in your
            head for hours “for and against” it. Tell yourself that you will think about it later. Once in the gym,
            surrounded by similar souls, you suddenly won’t feel that tired or uninspired.
            <br>
            <br>
            Another way to overcome procrastination is to create routines and follow them. Once the habit sets in,
            suddenly getting up at 6 am for work or writing for an hour every day won’t be so dreadful.

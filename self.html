        </div>
        <p id="selfText"> The American Canadian psychologist Albert Bandura developed the self-efficacy theory in 1982.
            Efficacy is our own belief in whether we can achieve the goals we set for ourselves.
            <br>
            <br>
            In other words, it’s whether we think we “got what it takes” to be successful at what we do. It’s not hard
            to see the link of self-efficacy to higher self-esteem, better performance, and enhanced motivation. People
            with high self-efficacy are more likely to put extra effort into their actions, self-set more challenging
            goals, and be more driven to improve their skills.
            <br>
            <br>
            Therefore, the belief that we can accomplish something serves as a self-fulfilling prophecy — it motivates
            us to try harder to prove to ourselves that we can do it.
